          I developed the backend of the atlasia.ma website using Firebase technology for the AtlasIA team. I streamlined backend processes to enable easy data import to Hugging Face, supporting open-source collaboration. Additionally, I created a responsive frontend design compatible with both mobile devices and PCs, enhancing the website's functionality and accessibility, and contributing to the overall success of the AtlasIA project.
